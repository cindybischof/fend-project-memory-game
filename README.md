## How to Play
You can play this classic memory game on any web browser. Click on any two cards to make them flip over to see if you get a match. Keep trying to get matches until you find all 8 pairs. The game features a timer, so you can track how long each round of the game takes. There is also a moves counter, which will tell you how many moves (2 card flips) you've made. Also, you will get a star rating based on the number of moves it takes you to win the game. There is also a refresh button in the upper right corner to start the game over. This button will flip all the cards back over as will as reset the timer, moves counter and star rating.
